The system shall include a "Pick Random Film" button that, when pressed, triggers the system to filter the IMDb database and return a randomly selected film that meets the rating requirement.  
**Movie Retrieval and Filtering** The system shall query the IMDb database to retrieve films with a rating equal to or higher than the user-selected rating value. The filtered films will then be randomly selected.  
For each selected film, the system shall retrieve the following data:
 - Title
 - Year
 - Duration
 - Rating
 - Votes
 - Description

**Movie Poster Retrieval** The system shall use the TMDB API to fetch the movie poster corresponding to the randomly selected film. The poster shall be displayed alongside the other movie details.

### 3.2 Performance Requirements
**Response Time** The system shall return the randomly selected film, along with its details, within 3 seconds of the user pressing the "Pick Random Film" button, assuming a stable internet connection.  
The system shall ensure that the time required to filter the IMDb database and retrieve the movie poster from the TMDB API does not exceed 2 seconds.  
**Concurrency** The system should be able to handle at least 100 concurrent users requesting random films without significant degradation in performance or responsiveness.  
**Accuracy of Data** The system shall ensure that only films with ratings greater than or equal to the user-selected value are returned in the filtered result.

### 3.3 Interface Requirements
**User Interface** The system shall provide an intuitive, web-based user interface with the following elements:
 - A slider to select the minimum rating value.
 - A "Pick Random Film" button to trigger the film selection process.
